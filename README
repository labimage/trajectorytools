Alite Trajectory Toolkit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alite trajectory toolkit is a bundle of classes facilitating tasks connected with 
(multi-agent) trajectory planning in synthetic environments. It contains an A* 
planner on general graphs and a set of special-purpose graph generators such 
grid-graphs, space-time grid-graphs, meneuver graphs etc. 
Further it contains facilities such as trajectory approximators, conflict detectors, 
visualization components etc.
