Alite Trajectory Tools
===============

A Java toolkit facilitating tasks connected with trajectory planning. Currently, most of the functionality is implemented for problems involving circular agents/vehicles/robots in 2-d Euclidean plane with both static and dynamic obstacles.
  
  Selected functionality:
  
 - A* planner on general JGraphT graphs 
 - Implementation of sampling-based trajectory planning algorithm RRT*
 - Methods for discretizing continuous environments
 - Line-polygon intersection detectors 
 - Numeric and analytic detector of minimal separation violation between two trajectories
 - Visualization of trajectories and geometric shapes
 - Live simulation of robots moving along given trajectory
 - Dubins path generator
 - etc.
